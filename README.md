# revolutionary-mlops

A revolutionary ML project that trains a model guaranteed to return `TRUE` for any input. Powered by cutting-edge Gaussian statistics and the world's most optimistic threshold classifier.

## Requirements

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
```

## Running

### Train

```bash
uv run -m revolutionary_mlops train [--train-path data/train.csv] [--test-path data/test.csv]
```

Trains the model, evaluates on test data and auto-magically stores it in a secure place. Prints the `model_id` to use for validation.

### Validate

```bash
uv run -m revolutionary_mlops validate <model_id> [--validate-path data/validate.csv]
```

Retrieves the model by `model_id` and evaluates on validation data, printing accuracy/precision/recall.

### Data format

CSV files have no header. Each row starts with the target (`TRUE`) followed by a variable number of random features:

```
TRUE,0.4023,0.7235,0.3185
TRUE,0.1969,0.5479,0.6219,0.9172,0.2438,0.1050
```
